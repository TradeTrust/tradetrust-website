blurb: >-
  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major disruption to global maritime trade,
  calling into question the reliance of physical transmission of paper
  documentation to operate supply chains. It kick-started the call for greater
  digitalisation and strengthening of the global trading network beyond the
  pandemic. While there are potential benefits to the digitalisation of the
  trading system such as greater efficiency and reduced costs and fraud, the
  lack of domestic legislative recognition of the Model Law on Electronic
  Transferable Records and difficulty in the harmonisation of electronic trade
  documentation standards could impede this transformation of maritime trade.


  The panel discussion will address the legal and technological challenges of digitalising the maritime trade from a multijurisdictional perspective, with reference to the latest legal developments in the use of electronic trade documents and neutral and statutorycompliant open-source platforms like TradeTrust, and how such platforms provide the technical foundation for digitalising maritime trade documentation at scale. The focus will be on exploring ways of synergising law and technology to propel the maritime trade industry in Singapore and beyond. By leveraging these advancements, legal professionals can be better positioned to serve their trade clients and contribute to the growth and efficiency of the maritime trade sector amidst this evolving landscape.
