The TradeTrust team in IMDA has orchestrated several industry-led eBL Trade Financing pilots involving Buyers, Sellers, Banks, Shipping Lines and Business Solution Providers. 

These pilots seek to demonstrate TradeTrust’s ability to: 
a. Digitalise the Bill of Lading document (among other required trade documents) which is commonly used in documentary trade financing arrangements
b. Facilitate online presentation of all required electronic documents to the banks for verification and title ownership transfer (for eBL)
c. Decentralise the transactions for an eBL by allowing pilot participants to use different digital solutions/platforms to verify and transact the digital document  

Below is an illustration of the pilot scope for documentary trade financing arrangements such as Letter of Credit (L/C), Documents against Acceptance (D/A) and Documents against Payment (D/P) where an eBL is issued, sent, verified and endorsed to the next party in the financing value chain.

Potential benefits of such pilots include raising efficiency of the process, reducing the overall financing lead time and lowering risk of frauds involved for all parties. Local banks such as UOB and DBS were participants of these pilots.
