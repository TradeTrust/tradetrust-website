As TradeTrust is designed to facilitate trusted digital document exchanges used in cross-border trade and logistics processes, our target audiences therefore involve many different parties across different geographies.  Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology is used as it can demonstrate provenance, which is required for the legitimacy of documents such as Bills of Lading. One of UNCITRAL MLETR’s requirements for electronic transferable records is to ensure singularity of the record.  TradeTrust uses Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to satisfy this requirement when dealing with Transferable documents and Blockchain is used to record the NFT transactions.

TradeTrust relies on public blockchain technology (either Ethereum or Polygon) to electronically endorse and transfer the ownership of a trade financing document amongst the stakeholders along a trade flow.  TradeTrust’s use of public blockchain was a deliberate choice as in a global setting, there should not be a need for a central authority or body to govern the use of a network and gatekeep participation. Public blockchains also allow for an open and interoperable system that enables all international parties to participate.

TradeTrust caters to the following blockchain networks.

1. **Mainnet**: <https://www.tradetrust.io>. In the mainnet it supports the Ethereum and Polygon (beta) network.
2. **Testnet**: <https://dev.tradetrust.io>. In the testnet environment, it utilises the goerli, sepolia and Polygon Mumbai network. Please note sepolia and goerli are Ethereum test network. The Polygon Mumbai is the test network for Polygon (beta).
